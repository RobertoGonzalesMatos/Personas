      "3": "Wait times vary significantly based on the individual's patience and urgency. Mostly its between 1-5 minutes. Some are willing to wait as long as necessary if they are not in a rush, whereas others wonâ€™t wait more than a minute.",
      "4": "There is a shared perception that the elevators are slow and inefficient, especially at peak hours. Issues like unclear direction indicators and unintuitive button layouts contribute to dissatisfaction. Some experience occasional confusion but don't consider it a major problem, while others feel the entire system could be more streamlined.",
      "5": "Malfunctions are rare, and most interviewees do not report significant breakdowns. However, one respondent mentioned experiencing an elevator going in the wrong direction due to unclear indicators. Overall, while technical failures are uncommon, the perceived inefficiencies create a sense of inconvenience.",
      "6": "The most common confusion stems from the door-closing buttons. Users struggle to differentiate between >< and >|<. Another issue mentioned is unclear swipe access feedback. Some interviewees also felt that choosing between elevators adds uncertainty. The larger one tends to take longer while the smaller one often gets overcrowded.",
      "7": "Suggestions include clearer floor indicators, better swipe access feedback, and have better labeling for 'open' and 'close' to avoid confusion. Some also want the elevator interior to be redesigned, as its current look is uninviting.",

              Analysis of CIT's Elevators
            </h2>
            <p>
              For Computer Science students at Brown University, one of the most
              frequently visited buildings is the Center for Information
              Technology (CIT). To navigate between floors, most students rely
              on the two available elevators. However, is the current system as
              efficient and user-friendly as it could be?
            </p>
            <p>
              This project aims to analyze the elevator interface using
              personas, allowing for a deeper understanding of both its
              strengths and pain points. Through this approach, I will assess
              the user experience and identify potential areas for improvement.

              This project has allowed me to understand how the use of personas
              can help me better internalize the workflow and intent of
              interfaces. In this case having individuals who pose constraints
              different from the "common average user" allows me to take into
              consideration accesibility or pain points which, if fixed, will
              favor many. This process is further excemplified with the use of a
              story board which allows me to plan out how specific users will
              interact with the selected interface. Additionally, having empathy
              maps helps to better understand the characters created and better
              embody their experience to tailor the interface analysis to them.
